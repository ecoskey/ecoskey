I'm a current student at UC davis, enthusiastic about graphics programming, game design, and digital photography. I'm a contributor to the [Bevy Game Engine](https://github/com/bevyengine/bevy) and (try to) maintain several other small libraries. You can reach me at the email listed on my profile :)
